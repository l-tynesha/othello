Team Roles:
Tynesha Pham: I implemented the minimax search tree and later adjusted it to 
perform alpha-beta pruning.

Yuchen Tang: I designed and continually refined the AI heuristics and 
implemented them accordingly.

We started off with very simple heuristics and made improvements over time 
to integrate different Othello strategies. We believe our strategies work because
we integrated these heuristics from well-known, successful strategies such as
accouting for mobility, corners, edges, spaces adjacent to corners, etc.
We tried implementing more advanced strategies such as accounting for frontier spaces 
and stability but we didn't want these strategies to possible interfere with the 
heuristics we already implemented.
